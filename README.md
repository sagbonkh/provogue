# Project Title

Provogue

## Slogan

Provoke. En Vogue. Provogue.

## Overview

Provogue is a web application that provides tailors with everything they need to book clients and get paid easier.

### Problem

The purpose of Provogue is simply to allow artists to focus on their craft. Tailors have to spend too much time focusing on the mundane things that are necessary to run a business. Provogue is supposed to relieve tailors so that they can focus on making beautiful clothes.

### User Profile

The web app is primarily intended for tailors. However other trade professionals may use it how they please.

### Features

-Invoice generator
-Contract generator
-Questionaire generator
-Quote generator

## Implementation

### Tech Stack

List technologies that will be used in your app, including any libraries to save time or provide more functionality. Be sure to research any potential limitations.

-ReactJS
-JavaScript
-SASS
-MySQL
-Knex
-Maybe Clerk Api

### APIs

I plan to create and use my own REST APIs

### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.

-Home page - The main page that users see when they visit
-Login page - accessible from login button on header. Page for signing in.
-Example page - Shows examples of the products we have on offer.
-Products page - Lists each product we offer and allows a user to select the desired product.
-Invoice page - Page to generate an invoice for a customer
-Contract page - Page to generate a contract for a customer
-Questionaire page - Page to generate a questionaire (To get requirements and specifications) for a customer.
-Quote page - Page to generate a quote for a customer (for a service)

### Mockups

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use tools like Figma or pictures of hand-drawn sketches.

### Data

### Endpoints

These are rough drafts at the moment.
-Login/ signup endpoints
-Fetch customer booking information
-Post new customer booking

### Auth

I might use Passport. Or JWT authentication depending on time. This is because I want to implement Social signin with Google and other platforms.

## Roadmap

I will start with the Front-end first so that I would have something to submit at the very least.

## Nice-to-haves

None at the moment.
