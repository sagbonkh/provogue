## Overview

Provogue: Streamlining Tailoring and Client Engagement

Provogue is an innovative web application designed to revolutionize the way tailors manage bookings, client interactions, and projects. Tailors can effortlessly handle everything from client management to project execution, ensuring a seamless workflow. For clients, Provogue offers a dynamic platform to easily monitor projects, provide specifications, and book services. This dual-functionality makes Provogue the go-to solution for tailors and their clients, optimizing every aspect of the tailoring experience.

### Problem

The purpose of Provogue is simply to allow artists to focus on their craft. Tailors have to spend too much time focusing on the mundane things that are necessary to run a business. Provogue is supposed to relieve tailors so that they can focus on making beautiful clothes.

### User Profile

The web app is primarily intended for tailors as well as their clients. There will be two different types of accounts. Client and Tailor accounts.
